# High Availability

- High Availability = Redundancy
- Layers of availability
  1. Hardware-level availability
      - Handled by Azure
  2. Server-level availability
      - **Availability Sets**
        - Ensures 99.95% SLA for VMs in availability set
        - Provides server level fault tolerance within a single data center within a single region.
        - Availabiliy sets are containers/racks that's called Fault Domains.
        - 2 VM's in same Availability Sets = Azure places those in different availability sets.
        - Update domains are different domains in different availability sets (fault Domains) and your VM's are set in different update domains as well.
        - Microsoft automatically assigns Virtual Machines across 2 fault domains (physical servers) and 5 update domains to minimize   uptime during planned and unplanned outages by default. The maximum number of FD is 3 and the maximum number of UD is 20.
          - Protects availability against VM shutdowns because of update failures / hardware shutdowns.
        - ❗ Must assign availability set at VM deployment
        - ❗ Scaling (resizing) requires stopping all VMs in the availability set.
        - For single VM not in availability set you have 99.9% availability if you use premium storage.
  3. Datacenter-level
      - **Availability Zones**
        - Allows you to place redundant VM's in different regions.
        - Provides data center level tolerance.
        - Load balancers are availability zone aware on standard SKU
        - ❗ You have to use managed disks
  4. Region-level
      - You need recovery service vault (storage for back-ups/replications)
        - **VM backup**
          - Ad-hoc or scheduled
          - Includes all disks and configurations
        - **Azure Site Recovery**
          - **Failover recovery**
            - 15 minute RPO (recovery point objective)
            - **Azure-to-Azure (A2A) ASR Architecture**
              - Directly available in VM blade
              - All storage data, VM's, disks (managed and unmanaged), subnets etc.
                - Prepared and ready to go in another region.
                - In sync
                - ❗ May require configuration with IP addresses
                - You can failover to it and/or failback
            - Configure in VM blade -> Disaster recovery
              - Allows you to configure disaster recovery for single VM
                - For workloads including multiple VM's you should configure it directly from Site Recovery
              - You can choose to automate what happens using Automation rubooks.
              - You can then view recovery status in same blade
                - Replication health
                - Recovery points
                  - Crash-consistent:
                    - Least preferable
                    - As if VM is replicate while it was powered off, no guarantees
                  - App-consistent
                    - Preferable point to recover
                    - Data and OS back
                - Commit -> Finalizes the failover
                - Re-protected -> Creates new recovery environment from old recovery enviroment (which becomes source nevironment)
          - **Migration to Azure**
            - On-premises to Azure
            - AWS to Azure

## Azure Advisor

- Gives recommendation regarding high availability
- E.g.:
  - Add more virtual machines for improved fault tolerance *(medium impact)*
  - Enable VM backup to protect your data from corruption and ccidental deletion *(medium impact)*
  - Create an Azure service health alert *(low impact)*

## VM Events

- Planned maintenance events
- Unexpected downtime events
- Notification
  - In Azure support webpage, status webpage, twitter account
  - Administrators get e-mail notifications
