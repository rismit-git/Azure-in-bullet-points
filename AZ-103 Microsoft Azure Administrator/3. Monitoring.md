# Monitoring

## Azure Monitor

- Centralized ways of getting insights from application to infrastructure
- You can diagnose, trace and debug issues
- Uses ML to detect anomolies and reveal hidden patterns
- Track how customers interact with the application
- ***Components***: Alerts, metrics, action groups, monitoring & reporting, dashbaord, logs
- ***High level view***
  - Collects data from: *Application*, *operating system*, *resources*, *subcription*, *tenant*
  - Populates stores: Metrics & logs
  - Perform functions:
    - ***Insights***: Application, container, VM, monitoring solutions
    - ***Visualize***: Dashboards, views, Power BI, Workbooks
    - ***Analyze***: Metrics Explorer, Log Analytics
    - ***Respond***: Alerts, Autoscale
    - ***Integrate***: Event Hubs, Logic Apps, Ingest & Export APIs

## Alerts  

- Notifies when important conditions are found in the monitoring data
- Flow of alerts:
  - Alert Rule [Target Resource *(Signal)* -> Criteria *(Logic Test)*] ->
    - Action Group *(Actions to do)*
    - Monitor condition *(Alert State)*
- Alert rules have single of each properties:
  - **Target resource**
    - Scope & signals for alerting.
    - E.g. VM
  - **Signal**
    - Emitted by target resource
    - Can be metrics, activity log, application insights and log.
  - **Criteria**
    - Combination of *signal* and *logic* applied on target resources.
    - E.g. less than X CPU usage.
  - **Logic**
    - User-defined logic to verify that signal is within expected range/values.
    - E.g. less than **30%** CPU usage.
  - Alert name
  - Alert description
  - **Severity**
    - Alert once the criteria specified in the alert.
    - Can range from 0 to 4.
  - **Action**
    - Specific action taken when the alert is fired.
- You can alert on:
  - Metric values
  - Log search queries
  - Health of underlying Azure platform
  - More..
- State of alerts:
  - ***New***: Created or fired
  - ***Acknowledged***: Issue is reviewed.
  - ***Closed***: Issue has been resolved.
    - Can be reopened by changing its state.
  - User changes state from New.

## Log types

- **Diagnostic Logs**
  - Non-compute resources: Resource metrics
  - Compute resources: Guest OS (e.g. syslog for Linux, event logs for Windows)
  - Azure Monitoring Agents
    - **Azure Diagnostics Extension** (cloud only)
      - Windows Server and Linux
      - useful for basic resource-level monitoring
      - Deployed automatically to VM when you enable it.
      - Boot diagnostics (serial console)
    - **Log Analytics Agent** (hybrid solution)
      - Can collect logs from Azure & on-prem systems to same namespace.
- **Application Logs**
  - Trace event streams
  - Programmed in application itself.
  - Application Insights
    - Instrumentation tool
    - HTTP requests
    - Dependency Calls (to e.g. SQL, external services, background services)
- **Activity Logs**
  - Azure infrastructure logs
  - E.g.
    - *Who created VM?*
    - *Who configured this VNet?*
    - *Traffic stream from NSG?*
  - Can be sent to: Log Analytics, Event Hubs, Azure Storage

## NSG (Network Security Group) Flow logging

- Flow logs handled by NSG's.
- Plot using
  - In-built Azure plotting tool **Network Watcher**
  - Power BI

## Azure Cost Management

- Can be eached through ***Cost analysis*** blade of desired scope.
- In *Cost analysis* you can filter by *Tag*s.
- Cost Management shows organizational cost and usage patterns with advanced analytics
- Reports show your internal and external costs for usage and Azure Marketplace charges
- You can automate periodically export of your costs
  - 💡 You can also see daily usage data in Azure Account Center -> Billing history -> Current period -> Download usage
- Data is consumed by other Azure resources
- Predictive analytics are also available.

## Metrics

- Collected one-minute frequency
- Uniquely identified in a namespace.
- 💡 Stored for 93 days
  - Collected in Azure metrics database (time series database)
  - 💡 Copy to Log Analytics for long term storage
- Holds value properties: Time, Type, Resource, Value, Multiple Dimensions
- Value:
  - Health of application: can help to identify route cause.
  - Valuable when combined with other metrics.
- Sources of metrics:
  - ***Platform metrics***
    - Each resource provides
    - Visibility into health and performance
  - ***Application metrics***
    - Generated by application insights
    - Detect performance issues & track trends
  - ***Custom metrics***
    - ❗ Must be created in same region as the resource that has the metrics
- Use-cases: Metrics explorer, Metric Alert Rule, Auto Scale, Route & Stream, Archive, Access

## Third party tools

- **ITSM**
  - IT as a Service
  - Helps to design, plan, deliver, operate, and control information technology (IT) services
  - **Azure ITSM Connector**:
    - Bi-directional connection layer between and your ITSM tool(s)
    - Use cases:
      - Create ITSM work items based on Azure alerts.
      - Sync ITSM incident/change request data to Azure.
- **SIEM**
  - Security information and event management
  - Example: Splunk (there's an open source add-on to send to Event Hubs)

## Action groups

## Monitoring and reporting on spend

- Two ways to understand Azure bill:
  1. Compare usage and costs (invoice) with usage file
      - Detailed usage CSV file shows charges & daily usage in billing period
        - Download:
          1. Sign into the Azure account Center as the Account Administrator
          2. Select the subscription for which you want the invoice and usage information
          3. Select billing history -> Download usage
        - Select billing history
  2. Compare the usage and costs with Azure portal
      - Subscription -> Cost analysis -> Filter by Timespan
- See estimated costs: Subscription -> Usage and estimated costs

## Log Analytics

- Old: OMS, new: Embedded in Azure Monitor as Logs.
- It's a dataware house for telemetry
  - It converts any schema to a table schema that allows you to query.
    - Uses KQL (pipe-based) language to query.
- All monitoring roads lead to Azure Log Analytics
  - There's always an integaration from an logging Azure component to Log Analytics.
- You can download agents in Workspace -> Connect
  - Agents do not require VPN
  - ***System Center Operations Manager*** can send data to Log Analytics from cloud/on-prem servers.
- ***Azure Data Explorer*** -> Query language is used & viewed
  example: search in (Event) "error"
  (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-portal)

- ***Alert rule***
  - Based on each query that run on regular intervals, results are evaulated to trigger an alert.
  - ***Target***: Specific Azure resource
  - ***Criteria***: Specific logic to trigger an action
    - ***Log Alerts*** describes where signal is custom query based on Log Analytics
  - ***Action***: Call to send a notification
  - Set-up in Log Analytics -> Alerts
- ***Export***: Excel, PowerBI
- Application Insights data is used in a different partition in Log Analytics.
  - E.g. requests, traces, usages
  - Allows you to cross application queries
- ***Function***: Queries can be saved as functions to be used within another query.
- Requires log analytics workspace

## Create performance baselines

- Baseline
  - Configuration management term
  - Signifies an agreed-upon description of product attributes, per unit time, which serves as a basis for defining change.
  - 💡 It's not only recommended but mandatory for team to develop a baseline.
    - Gather diagnostics for long enough time.
      - Capture all peaks and values over ordinary usage.
      - Enable streams and create baseline
    - Even analyze those and agree upon which performance ranges are acceptable to define SLA's.
    - Helps to isolate pr oblem
- Baselining in Azure
  1. Continous monitoring
  2. Normal operational parameters
  3. Alerts on deviations
  4. Take proactive corrective actions
- Baselines actions
  - ***Enable diagnostics monitoring and telemetry***, e.g.:
    - Azure IaaS resources
    - Azure App Service apps
  - ***Creating performance baselines***
    - Analyze diagnostics output
    - Plot metrics
